              We structure the web using HTML, which defines the content of a
              webpage, including texts, images, and links. It's the foundation
              that organizes and presents information clearly to users.

              We design the look and feel of your website with CSS, ensuring it
              is visually appealing, responsive, and user friendly. CSS allows
              us to control the layout, color scheme, fonts, and overall
              aesthetics of your website.

              animations, JavaScript powers the engaging experiences that keeps
              users connected and involved with your platform.

                LearnFactory has been a beacon of hope for a lot of youths who
                have the zeal and passion for software development and
                programming. From the inception, my experience at learnfactory
                has been nothing short of inspirational, from the online
                classes, our tutor has broken down the steps to learning HTML,
                CSS and JavaScript, setting us up for a productive future and
                career. I'm glad I came to Learnfactory and met a lot of amazing
                people, including our wonderful tutor and made some lasting
                connections that will carry me through in this journey.
